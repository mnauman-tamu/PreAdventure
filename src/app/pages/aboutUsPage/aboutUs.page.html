  <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-grey u-text-5"> <br>We are students at Texas A&amp;M University who created this webpage in the CSCE 315 class. <br>When planning a trip you often need to search through several applications and websites to gather all the information and guidance you need. Such a process is tedious and time-consuming often feeling more like research/work which is why our application will combine all the information you might need in one place so the user is left with a stress-free planning experience. With all the information in one place, the user will no longer have to scour the internet for random sites that have bits of information, instead the user will be free to focus on what is important, how to make their trip/vacation experience the best it can be.<br><br></p>
